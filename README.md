## üîç What's This All About?

Welcome to my Compiler Design Laboratory - where we turn caffeine into compilers! This repository documents my journey through the fascinating world of language processing, lexical analysis, parsing techniques, and code generation.

## üß© What You'll Find Here

This repository contains implementations of various compiler components including:

- **Lexical Analyzers**: Token recognition using Python regex magic ‚ú®
- **Syntax Parsers**: Where grammar rules, parse trees, and recursive descent come to life
- **Semantic Analyzers**: Because knowing what code *means* is kind of important
- **Intermediate Code Generation**: The middle step between human thoughts and machine execution
- **Code Optimization**: Making programs run faster than a caffeinated programmer on a deadline
- **Target Code Generation**: Translating to machine code (or at least getting pretty close)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python (91.4%)**: The primary language for most implementations
- **C (8.6%)**: For when we need to get closer to the metal
- **Flex & Bison**: For some of the more advanced lexer and parser generators
- **Lots of patience**: For debugging recursive descent parsers at 3 AM

## üìö Lab Assignments

| Lab # | Topic | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Lexical Analysis | Building scanners and tokenizers |
| 2 | Top-Down Parsing | Recursive descent and LL parsing |
| 3 | Bottom-Up Parsing | Shift-reduce and LR parsing techniques |
| 4 | Semantic Analysis | Type checking and symbol tables |
| 5 | Intermediate Code | Three-address code and abstract syntax trees |
| 6 | Code Optimization | Constant folding, loop optimization |
| 7 | Code Generation | Translating to target machine code |

## üö¶ Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rhr18818/Compiler_Design_Lab.git
   cd Compiler_Design_Lab
   ```

2. Navigate to specific lab directories to explore individual assignments

3. Most Python implementations can be run with:
   ```bash
   python3 filename.py
   ```

4. C programs can be compiled and executed with:
   ```bash
   gcc filename.c -o output
   ./output
   ```

## üß† Fun Compiler Facts

- **Did you know?** The first compiler was developed by Grace Hopper in 1952!
- **Compiler Joke:** Why do programmers always mix up Christmas and Halloween? Because Oct 31 == Dec 25! (Only compiler folks will get this without explanation)
- **Mind-blowing fact:** Modern compilers often do a better job optimizing code than humans can by hand

## üåü Final Thoughts

Remember, writing a compiler is like solving a puzzle where you're simultaneously creating and solving the puzzle pieces. Enjoy the journey!
